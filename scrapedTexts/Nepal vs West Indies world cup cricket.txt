Heinrich Klassen's decisive run-out on the final delivery secured a nail-biting one-run victory for South Africa against Nepal, ending the Asian side's hopes of advancing to the Super Eight stage in the Ground D match of the ICC T20 World Cup at the St. Vincent Stadium. Needing two runs from the last ball to stay alive in the tournament, Nepal's Gulsan Jha was run out at the non-striker's end by Klaasen, preventing what seemed like an inevitable Super Over. It was a heartbreaking end for Nepal, who had outperformed South Africa for much of the match.

However, fans were quick to spot a huge umpiring blunder. On the last ball, Ottneil Baartman bowled a short-pitched delivery to Gulshan, who tried to flick it towards the point region. However, the extra bounce on the delivery saw Gulshan mistime his shot.

#HeinrichKlaasen's act on the last ball meant Nepal's heroic performance went in vain!

Fans on social media, however, argued that the ball should have been called a wide. They even shared screenshots on social media to back their argument.

Here's how internet reacted:

Another umpiring decision cost a match bartman bowled 2 bouncers in last 2 balls he was given warning this last was over his head but SA intentionaly diverted umpires from calling wide & even comentators were sleeping thats why batters ran slowly as it was wide #Nepal pic.twitter.com/UHm0yFLaWT â€” Adil Ali Shah (@AdilAliShah13) June 15, 2024

Bad umpiring cost Nepal this match. In last over Bartman bowled 2 bouncers one of them was wide. â€” remon (@remoon125) June 15, 2024

Nepal's spinners had dominated, restricting South Africa to a modest 115/7. The South African innings was anchored by opener Reeza Hendricks, who scored 43 runs, while Tristan Stubbs was the only other batter to cross a strike rate of 100, finishing unbeaten on 27 off 18 balls. Nepal's bowlers, Kushal Bhurtel and Dipendra Singh Airee, were exceptional, sharing seven wickets between them and keeping the Proteas' batters in check.

In response, Nepal looked well on their way to victory. Their top-order batsmen had the chase under control, reaching 85/2 by the 14th over with the required rate comfortably manageable.

However, South African spinner Tabraiz Shamsi turned the tide with a brilliant spell, taking 4/19, which put immense pressure on the Nepali chase. Fast bowlers Anrich Nortje and Ottneil Baartman then held their nerve, bowling the final two overs to perfection and leaving Nepal needing eight runs from the last over.

The tension peaked as Gulsan Jha struck a boundary off the third ball of the final over, bringing the equation down to two runs from the last ball. Klassen's quick reflexes and sharp throw ensured that Jha was caught short of the crease, sealing a memorable win for South Africa and breaking Nepalese hearts.

Needing eight runs off the final over in pursuit of a modest target of 116 for a stunning upset win, the Nepalese fell agonisingly short at 114 for seven with Gulshan Jha run out off the final ball as he attempted a single off Ottneil Baartman to force a super over.

After leg-break bowler Kushal Bhurtel (4 for 19) and off-spinner Dipendra Singh Airee (3 for 21) limited the Proteas to 115 for seven batting first, Aasif Sheikh (42) and Anil Sah (27) featured in a 50-run third-wicket partnership which pulled the Nepalese within touching distance of a result which would have kept their hopes alive of getting to the Super Eight phase of the tournament.

"Very proud of the unit, especially the way we bowled and batted. We saw the wicket yesterday and thought it will be on the slower side. We saw that it helped spinners and thats when we introduced Kushal Bhurtel and carried on with the spinners," said Nepal skipper Paudel after the loss.

"We were so close yet a little far. We didnt do well in the crunch moments but we fought very well. Well be on the other side next time if we play teams like this more often. I want to thank the fans for supporting us. We are very grateful to them," he added.

Denied US visa, Nepal's most high-profile cricketer Sandeep Lamichhane is joining his team for its Caribbean leg of the T20 World Cup campaign, the country's cricket association said on Monday. Lamichhane, who had an eight-year sentence for rape overturned on appeal because of "lack of evidence", was denied US visa twice last month despite interventions from the Nepal government. The 23-year-old was initially included in Nepal's 15-member squad for the tournament last month. The T20 World Cup is being co-hosted by the United States and West Indies. "We would like to inform you that Nepali player Sandeep Lamichhane will be included in the Nepali national cricket team for the ongoing ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2024 in West Indies," the CAN said in a statement.

Lamichhane also confirmed the development on X.

"I am now joining the national team for the last two matches in the West Indies and looking forward to fulfilling my dreams and the dream of all cricket lovers," Lamichhane posted on X, formerly Twitter.

He was arrested in October 2022 over allegations of raping an 18-year-old woman, leading to his suspension by the CAN. But after he was acquitted by the Patan High Court in May, the player was reinstated by the country's apex cricket body.

Lamichhane's addition to the Nepal squad will have to be approved by the ICC's Event Technical Committee.

Nepal take on South Africa on June 14 and play Bangladesh on June 16.
