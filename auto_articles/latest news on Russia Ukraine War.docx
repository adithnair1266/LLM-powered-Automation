**Russia-Ukraine War: EU Sanctions Package Faces Resistance, Ukraine Seeks Ban on Russian LNG Exports**

As the war between Russia and Ukraine continues to ravage both countries, the European Union (EU) is preparing to implement its 14th sanctions package against Russia. However, the proposal is facing resistance from some EU member states, highlighting the challenges of implementing cohesive economic sanctions.

**EU Sanctions Package: A Necessary Step in Cutting Russia's Energy Exports?**

The EU sanctions package aims to further isolate Russia economically by targeting its energy sector. A key proposal is the ban on Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports. This move would cut off a significant source of revenue for Russia and decrease its ability to fund its military efforts in Ukraine.

"Weakening Russia's energy sector is a crucial aspect of our sanctions policy," said Vladyslav Vlasiuk, advisor to the office of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. "Russia's energy sector is a significant source of revenue, and by targeting it, we can limit their ability to fund their military efforts in Ukraine."

**Russia Pushes Back: Ukraine Seeking Ban on Russian LNG Exports**

Russia, however, has pushed back against the EU proposal to ban LNG exports. Kremlin officials argue that such a move would harm the EU more than it would Russia. Russia also claims that it can redirect its LNG exports to other countries, such as China and India.

"LNG is the leverage that Russia still maintains," said Nataliia Shapoval, a member of the Yermak-McFaul International Working Group on Russian Sanctions. "Russia is trying to play a 'cat and mouse game' to determine which critical components are propping up Moscow's military might and should therefore be banned."

**Ukraine-Russia Conflict Escalates: Nuclear War Threats Surface**

Meanwhile, the conflict between Ukraine and Russia has escalated, with both sides trading nuclear threats. On Thursday, senior Russian official Dmitry Medvedev warned that Russia would be forced to use tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine if Ukrainian forces were to strike inside Russia.

"If Ukraine decides to strike inside of Russia, we will consider it an act of war," said Medvedev. "And if it happens, we will be forced to take measures to protect our interests, including the use of tactical nuclear weapons."

U.S. President Joe Biden has partially lifted restrictions on how Ukraine can use military supplies sent by the U.S. Ukraine can now use American weapons to strike inside Russia, but only in defense of Kharkiv.

"This is a significant departure from where the Americans were at the beginning of the war," said Alex Rossi, Sky News international correspondent. "Now you have a situation where American guns and rocket launchers can be used to target positions inside a nuclear-armed country and enemy."

**Russia- Ukraine War Updates: Key Frontlines See Intensified Fighting**

As the conflict escalates, fighting has intensified on several key frontline areas. In the north, Russian troops are trying to bring their forces within tube artillery range of Kharkiv city. On the southern front, the battle is on to recapture villages liberated during Ukraine's counteroffensive last year and push further into Ukrainian territory.

In the east, Russia is making steady progress westwards in the direction of Pokrovsk, and Ukrainian forces are facing heavy artillery bombardment and air raids. The situation in Kharkiv remains precarious, with the city under constant attack.

**Conclusion**

As the war between Ukraine and Russia rages on, the international community is watching with growing concern. The EU's proposed sanctions package, which includes a ban on Russian LNG exports, is a crucial step in cutting off Russia's ability to fund its military efforts in Ukraine. While Russia has pushed back against the proposal, Ukraine and the EU remain committed to implementing effective sanctions to hold Russia accountable for its actions.

In the midst of this chaos, concerns of nuclear war continue to surface, with both sides trading threats. As the world watches, one thing is clear â€“ the fate of Ukraine and the world hangs in the balance.
