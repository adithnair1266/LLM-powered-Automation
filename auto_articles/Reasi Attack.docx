**Terror Strikes Reasi: 10 Killed, 33 Injured in Horrific Attack on Bus Carrying Pilgrims**

In a shocking and horrific incident, a bus carrying Hindu pilgrims was ambushed by suspected militants in Reasi district of Jammu and Kashmir on Sunday evening, leaving 10 people dead and 33 others injured.

According to eye witnesses, the bus was on its way from the Shiv Khori shrine to Katra when terrorists opened fire on the vehicle, causing the driver to lose control and the bus to plunge into a deep gorge. The attack occurred at around 6:10 pm when the bus was passing through the Pouni area of Reasi district, bordering Rajouri district.

The scene of the attack is described as chaotic, with passengers screaming and panic-stricken. "I went for darshan of Shiv Khori. While returning, some people opened fire on our bus. Later, the bus fell into a ditch. Several people were injured in the incident," one survivor recounted to ANI.

"I think there were 2-3 terrorists there. My son saw a man firing on our bus from behind," another survivor added.

The Reasi Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Mohita Sharma confirmed the death toll and said that at least two terrorists were involved in the attack. "Nine people are reportedly feared dead, and 33 were injured and are being treated in different hospitals," she said.

Rescue operations were carried out by the police, CRPF, and Army, with the bus driver being shot in the head by the terrorists. "The driver was shot in the head by the terrorists. He lost control and the vehicle fell into a ditch. They (the terrorists) did not stop firing and kept firing for 15 to 20 minutes, because of which some passengers also sustained bullet injuries," a local resident told ANI.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has condemned the attack and assured that those responsible will be punished. "I am shocked and saddened by the attack in Reasi. I have spoken to the Lt. Governor of Jammu and Kashmir and asked for the best possible medical care for the injured. The culprits of this dastardly attack will not be spared and will face the wrath of the law," he tweeted.

Joint Commissioner of Police, Jammu and Kashmir, S.D.Sinha said that a team from the National Investigation Agency (NIA) has reached the site of the attack, and forensic experts are working on collecting evidence.

The attack highlights the growing insecurity in Jammu and Kashmir, where militancy has been a persistent problem for decades. The region is divided between India and Pakistan, with both countries claiming ownership of the territory.

This attack is a chilling reminder of the vulnerability of pilgrims and travelers in Kashmir and the need for continued vigilance and security measures to ensure the safety of citizens.

As the investigation into the attack continues, residents of Reasi are now left to mourn the loss of life and pray for the recovery of the injured.
