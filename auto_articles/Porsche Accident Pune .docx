In a shocking turn of events, the Pune Police have uncovered a massive scandal in the Porsche car accident case that shook the city last month. The investigation revealed that the blood samples of the teenage driver, who was allegedly driving the car at the time of the accident, were tampered with by officials at Sassoon General Hospital.

The accident, which occurred on May 19, resulted in the death of two IT professionals and left several others injured. The 17-year-old driver, who was reportedly drunk at the time of the accident, was initially granted bail by the Juvenile Justice Board.
